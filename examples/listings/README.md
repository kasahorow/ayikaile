### Listings

**Overview**

Access the listings panel at:

```
https://fienipa.kasahorow.com/app?email=<your-email>&access=<your-access-code>
```

Replace `<your-email>` and `<your-access-code>` with your registered email and your access code.

**How it works**

- Open the app and go to the **Sell Listings** panel to create or manage listings.
- Each listing is associated with a **keyword** (a single word or short phrase).
- When a user searches for or uses that keyword in the app, the associated listing will be shown.

**Example**

```
https://fienipa.kasahorow.com/app?email=alice@example.com&access=abc123
```

**Notes & tips**

- Keep keywords clear and relevant so users can find your listing easily.
- If you don't have an access code, check [authentication](../README.md#authentication).
- Do not share your access code publicly.
